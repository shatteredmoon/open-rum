	<h1 class="u4m" style="text-align: left">CHAPTER II</h1>
	<h2 class="u4m">GEOGRAPHY</h2>

	<p>The final destruction of Exodus rocked the known world.  Mountains rose; land masses sank. Most of the surface area of the world became fused together into one large mass.  It is over this major continent -- now called Britannia -- that Lord British rules. Some nearby islands also pay homage to him, while beyond these islands lurk uncharted shoals and rumored pockets of evil.

	<p>Lord British's magnificent castle is situated in the centre of the continent, overlooking Britanny Bay. This tall building is the greatest architectural structure of the new age. Loyal subjects may pay homage to his majesty, and renew fealty whenever they are in the vicinity of his castle. Nearby lies the arts centre of Britannia -- the town of Britain -- where Bards weave tales of legendary deeds and serenade visitors.

	<p>To the north of the castle of Lord British lies the great mountain range, known as the Serpent's Spine. The peaks of this range are the highest in all Britannia. During the summer months, a small out-of-the-way pass allows knowledgeable travellers to save much time on their journeys. Beware of the one-eyed Cyclops and fierce, two-headed Ettins that inhabit this range.

	<p>Northwest from the mountains begin the vast woods known as the Deep Forest. Many a traveller has become lost among these tall, majestic trees. If they feet stray from the beaten path, do not despair, for within the woods lies the beautiful city of Yew, home of the mystic Druids. The High Court of Yew judges all the important cases in Britannia and is famed far and wide for the wisdom of the decisions rendered here.

	<p>Nearby is the spiritual centre of Britannia, the famous Empath Abbey. Within these hallowed walls, wise men and women study the ancient writings of past Masters, and meditate upon the Great Principles that govern the universe. A good meditation -- focusing on a proper Mantra -- will sometimes yield valuable visions to those whose patience and powers of concentration are strong. The experience is worth sampling.

	<p>East of the Deep Forest lie the High Steppes of Britannia, famous for beautiful horses. The only difficulties a traveller might encounter here are bands of thieving Rogues and unfriendly Wizards. The High Steppes border an interior lake fabled for mysterious disturbances.

	<p>Beyond the High Steppes lies the famous battlefield, known as the Bloody Plains, where the last major forces of evil were vanquished. Alas, many of our brave men perished here in the fight for virtue. Be very careful when thou passeth through this region. It is whispered that, at some phases of the moon, the undead rise and battle again.

	<p>Lost Hope Bay lies to the north of here, with the sturdy town of Minoc perched on its shore. Minoc is home to some of the finest craftsmen in the realm. The Tinkers of Minoc are known for their skill. A tired traveller will also find a refreshing place to rest at the Wayfarer's Inn. The northeastern tip of Britannia is rather wild. The treacherous mashes, with their noxious vapors that poison the unwary explorer, are home to swarms of insects and all manner of beasts.

	<p>South of Lord British's castle can be found a large plain, mountains, and a dense forest. On the southern edge of the continent is the magnificent town of Trinsic, from whence come Lord British's finest Paladins. The Tap in town has some of the best brew around, and the bartender is a great source of current gossip. Be sure to tip him well!

	<p>The claws of the southern tip of Britannia embrace the Cape of Heroes. Slightly to the west lie the Valarian Isles. The walled town of Jhelom provides Lord British with the best fighters and also has the largest inn of the realm, where the service is outstanding.

	<p>The headquarters for the Order of the Silver Serpent is on an island south of the Cape of Heroes. This wooded fortress was given to the members of the Order by Lord British in recognition of their outstanding service. A visit to Serpent Castle will instill within the traveller a true feeling for the ways of chivalry.

	<p>Off the western shore of Britannia is the island home of the doughty Rangers. Skara Brae is a beautiful city and spaciously laid out. For those suffering from rare diseases or grievous wounds, a Mystical Healer resides within those walls. The Healer will aid the destitute as readily as the wealthy, expecting no payment save what the sufferer can afford.

	<p>In the northeastern part of Britannia lies Verity Isle, famed as the home of the Lycaeum. This pillar of higher learning constitutes the centre for the sharpening of the finest minds in Britannia. The Lycaeum's observatory provides Lord British with valuable information about the course of the heavens and provides a vantage point to watch the happenings within his realm. On the southern end of Verity is situated the fabled town of Moonglow. The Magi of Moonglow are constantly improving their skills, being tireless in the pursuit of greater knowledge of the mystic arts. Within Moonglow, however, can be obtained the finest in mystical reagents. These herbs will help those with magical skills prepare and cast their spells.

	<p>This then is the known realm of Britannia. Several small villages also dot the landscape, but all are not recorded in the charts of the realm. Some other islands of varying significance hug the shoreline -- most of which are uninhabited and barren. The only islands the traveller should be cautious about when exploring are known as the Fens of the Dead. Disembodied Wisps, Ghosts, long-dead Lichs, and savage Zorns have been reported here.

	<p>Existing maps are by no means complete. There are said to be other unexplored isles, wherein all manner of monsters and evil beings reside: flame-breathing Dragons, multi-headed Hydras, horned Devils, fiery Lava Lizards and even dreaded Balrons are rumoured to roam the distant shores. Somewhere, out beyond civilization, is also reputed to lie the ruins of the legendary town of Magincia, which the gods destroyed for the

	<p><center><img src="img/whirl_pool.png" alt=""></center>

	<p>insufferable pride of those that dwelt there.  All of the magnificent marble palaces and gardens were devastated, and the right, haughty inhabitants reduced to haunting spirits. No one has ever confirmed this legend, so it may just be a fable to frighten the weak of the heart and instill humility in those who overvalue their own worth.

	<p>Sea travel along the coast of the main continent is reasonably safe, although a bold band of pirates has been raiding Britannia of late, terrorizing the populace. Beware, for the pirates take no prisoners! Farther out to sea roam many mythical creatures. The unwary voyager will likely encounter Giant Squids, Nixies, poisonous Serpents, and mystical Seahorses. The ever-present danger of whirlpools and waterspouts make seafaring a hazardous experience at best.

	<p>It is hoped that with the next edition of the History of Britannia, travellers will have brought back more information on these unexplored regions, so that the map my be completely filled in. As a final caution for the would be traveller -- Beware of the many Dungeons and their dark, subterranean passages!
