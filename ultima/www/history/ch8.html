	<h2 class="u4m">A BESTIARY</h2>

	<p><b>BAT</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A non-evil subterranean dweller found in the deepest caverns, the principal diet of the Bat is animal blood.  They are quite large and may attack any who disturb their rest.

	<p><b>CYCLOPS</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;These evil giants can hurl half-ton boulders down from the heights. Even a grazing hit will do considerable damage to a member of thy party. The Serpent's Spine is said to be the best hunting for them.

	<p><b>DRAGON</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The dragon is an evil, flying serpent which can cross water and blast ships with huge fireballs. Not many ships can withstand a couple of passes by an attacking Dragon.

	<p><b>ETTIN</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;These evil two-headed aberrations of nature can cast huge boulders down upon thy party, causing immense damage. It is best to try to kill them with long-range weapons and spells. A large clan of Ettins is said to live along the Serpent's Spine.

	<p><b>GAZER</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;These hypnotic creatures snare their prey by putting them to sleep. The deep forests are the favorite habitat of these evil, floating eyes.

	<p><b>GHOST</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The restless spirits of those trapped between planes, Ghosts can pass through walls, so use extreme caution when they are thought to be nearby. Evil Ghosts are often found in ruins, battlefields and crypts.

	<p><b>GREMLIN</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;These hungry denizens of the underworld love to sneak up to unwary travellers and steal all their food. Do not let an evil Gremlin next to thee!

	<p><b>HEADLESS</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Another evil being best suited to terror and destruction, the Headless is indeed a creature of nightmares. Many a traveller has fled in abject horror at the sight of these headless torso bearing down upon them.

	<p><b>HYDRA</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beware the evil breath of the multi-headed Hydra! The massive fireballs can fry most members of thy party.

	<p><b>INSECTS</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If thou dost stay clear of these non-evil vermin, they will not bother thee. Marsh and dungeons are their favorite locales. Insects can fly, so they can chase thee over water.

	<p><b>LICH</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;This undead shade of a powerful wizard can still cast very powerful magic spells. The Lich is a most dangerous opponent under even favorable conditions.

	<p><b>LAVA LIZARD</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;These reptilian creatures love fire and dwell in infernos. In combat, they have been known to spit flaming lava thirty feet, so beware these evil beasts!

	<p><b>MIMIC</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the most treacherous and evil creatures in all of Britannia, the Mimic can assume any shape, although they seem to prefer assuming the likeness of treasure chests. Upon spotting one, the careless traveller greedily rushes toward the chest. When the traveller gets close enough, the mimic casts out a poisonous venom. When the traveler succumbs to the poison, the Mimic feasts upon him. The only known way to detect a chest Mimic is to wait until it gets curious enough to peer out at thee by lifting the lid of the chest.

	<p><b>NIXIE</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;These aquatic first cousins of the ancient race of Elves rise from the depths to strike terror into the hearts of seafarers. The evil Nixies wield sharp tridents which can be hurled against a ship's crew from afar, causing great damage.

	<p><b>ORC</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Would that every orc had been destroyed with the fall of the Triad of Evil! They breed like rabbits and still infest the woods and hills, though in much smaller numbers than before.

	<p><b>PHANTOM</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;These tragic souls have been captured by evil and forced to reenact their battles throughout all time. They are bodiless, but can be detected because their swords and shields remain visible. Phantoms are tough opponents as dying is meaningless to them.

	<p><b>PIRATES</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Truly the dregs of Britannia, most of these crews have death warrants hanging over their heads. Remember that the evil pirates take no prisoners! Their ships are equipped with heavy cannons, and the crews are well-trained to quickly move their large galleons into battle position. It is a rare skipper indeed that can survive a broadside duel with a Pirate vessel. Thy best hope is to "dot the T" or to close with thy enemy. If thou art able to defeat the crew, the ship itself becomes thy prize. For castaways on remote islands, this is the only hope for salvation.

	<p><b>PYTHON</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The venom of a Britannia Python is highly poisonous. These non-evil constrictors can spit their foul venom a full eleven paces, and should be treated with the utmost respect.

	<p><b>RAT</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The common Giant Rat, while not evil by nature, will still enter human camps in search of food. They pose a threat to any dungeon explorers foolish enough to startle them.

	<p><b>REAPER</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;These grim creatures stand upright on trunk-like bodies and wave many tentacles at their prey. The evil reaper can also reputedly cast different energy fields, and thus is considered a most vicious opponent.

	<p><b>ROGUE</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Rogues that are to be found throughout the land are often escaped prisoners who now make their livelihood as highwaymen by attacking travellers. If they get next to thee, they may pick thy pockets.

	<p><b>SEAHORSE</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;These magical creatures appear quite fair and are not evil, but if offended they make devastating enemies. They are possessed of powerful magical abilities which can wreak havoc among thy party.

	<p><b>SERPENT</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Sea Serpent is an aquatic relative of the Dragon. The fireball cast by the Serpent can sink a ship long before it has a chance to close with the beast. The best defense against a Sea Serpent is to engage it in close combat as quickly as possible. It is thy only chance, albeit a slim one, to survive the encounter.

	<p><b>SKELETON</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Animated bones, the Skeletons are the undead incarnations of a variety of creatures. These tools of evil strike fear into ordinary travellers. With the proper enchantment, however, they can be Dispelled.

	<p><b>SLIME</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Dungeon walls fairly ooze with slime. Most slime just sits there, this evil variety comes after thee!

	<p><b>SPIDER</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Beware of inadvertently wrecking a spider's web and this non-evil creature will probably leave thee in peace. If thou suffer the misfortune of crossing one, take care to avoid the venomous spittle.

	<p><b>SQUID</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;When the tentacles of the Giant Squid close around a man or a ship, the very power of lightning is released upon the prey. 'Tis best to try to destroy the evil Squid within cannon fire before it can engage thee at close quarters.

	<p><b>TROLL</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;These large and evil creatures can hurl axes -- of which they carry a plentiful supply -- with frightening accuracy. Beware their tricks. Trolls are usually found in hills and mountains.

	<p><b>WISP</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;More insubstantial than most evil creatures, Wisps can actually teleport around the battlefield and attack from anywhere. It is most disconcerting to be involved in an encounter that contains a Wisp.

	<p><b>WIZARD</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all magic users follow the path of Good. These evil renegade Wizards make very dangerous adversaries when crossed.

	<p><b>ZORN</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Zorns are the antithesis of everything. They pass through walls and obstacles, and negate all nearby magic. If an evil zorn closes with thee, thou probably will not escape its embrace.

	<p><b>LORDS OF THE EVIL DOMINION</b>

	<p><b>BALRON</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is believed by some that all of these Marshals of Evil were destroyed when the Triad fell. If any do exist, it would be better for one to Quit life itself than to face the fury of a Balron. The ancient scrolls describe them as flying creatures which cast devastating fireballs as well as weave massive enchantments that once felled entire armies.

	<p><b>DEVIL</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;These flying Lieutenants of Evil may sweep offshore and chase thee across the waves. They are powerful magic users and should be avoided at all costs. Devils are particularly fond of torturing their victims when the opportunity arises.
