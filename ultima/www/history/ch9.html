	<h2 class="u4m">THE SKILLS OF COMBAT</h2>

	<p>The historian is a man of intellectual pursuits and therefore little acquainted with the ways of combat. For the following information on such skills, we are deeply indebted to the Master at Arms of the Order of the Silver Serpent.

	<p><b>BEFORE FIGHTING</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Be certain that thou art properly equipped for the ensuing fray. Dost thou have the proper weapon and armour? If not, then thou must equip thyself anew. When thou commence to Ready a weapon or Wear some armour, thou wilt be offered a selection of such items as are available in thy party's common pool. If thou dost choose an item inappropriate for thy class, thou wilt be asked to select again.

	<p><b>INITIATING COMBAT</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;When thou art next to an enemy, thou may Attack in the direction of thy foe. Thou wilt then be able to view thy combat location, and battle shall ensue.

	<p><b>BEING ATTACKED</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;If thou dost not attack a creature, then assuredly the creature will attack thee at its earliest opportunity, assuming that the creature is evil or hungry.

	<p><b>HOW TO FIGHT</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Each fighter and magic user will have an opportunity for separate action. Thou may only attack in the main cardinal direction (North, East, South, and West). When it is a fighter's turn, those with hand weapons may Attack an adjacent area by specifying the direction. Those with missile weapons may fire them across the battlefield by denoting the direction of fire. Magic users can Cast a spell when it is their turn. Again, only spells for which reagents have been prepared will function. The spell must be selected and the direction fixed. Most combat spells are functional across the field of battle. Energy fields, however, can be cast only in small areas adjacent to the caster.

	<p><b>VICTORY</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;When all of the monsters have been destroyed, thou wilt return to the surrounding countryside. If the monsters were carrying any treasure, this will now be available to thee. Care should be used in Opening any treasure chests, as they are frequently trapped.

	<p><b>FLEEING</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;There will come times in thy quests when thou wilt be confronted with superior forces. Whenever one of they team is near death, guide him or her off the combat field to save them. If the tactical situation deteriorates completely, removing all members of the party from the field will disengage thee from thy enemy. There are those who will call thy actions cowardly, but a wise leader will know the value of preserving the life of one's fellows.

	<p><b>TERRAIN CONSIDERATIONS</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Devote considerable time to the study of the fields of combat. Locate defensible positions for thy party, making sure to maintain an avenue of escape should the battle go badly. Remember our heritage! A few valiant fighters strategically placed in a narrow rocky pass can stand off an army numbered in the thousands.

	<p><b>WEAPON CONSIDERATIONS</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;There are three distinct classes of weapons available to the warrior. They are: Missile Weapons which permit the striking of foes at a distance; Polearms which allow one to smite over an obstacle or companions; and hand to hand weapons which necessitate engaging one's enemies at very close quarters.

	<p><b>ETHICS OF WAR</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not feel that it is thy birthright to slay everything that walks, flies or swims. The Code of Chivalry states that before engaging in combat with a foe, the warrior should ask, "Is this foe truly evil?" If it is not, then thou must not kill it, but stand thy ground and force it to retreat. The Code is thy touchstone, for without it thou are but a speck of dust in the whirlwind of Chaos.
