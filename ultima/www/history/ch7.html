	<h2 class="u4m">MAGICAL ARTS</h2>

	<p>Most of us understand only those things that we can see and feel. Yet there is a segment of the population that can see the unseeable, and can feel that which has no substance. The perception and use of these ethereal forces is called magic. To some it is an Art, to others a Science. It is difficult for this Historian to describe the Art in which he is totally unfamiliar. He can, however, comment upon what purports to be the Science.

	<p>The basis of all spellcasting is the proper mixing of the necessary reagents. Reagents are the physical materials which are said to provide the initial energy to begin the spell. Each spell uses a different reagent formula. These formulas are jealously guarded by magic users, for quite often the difference between life and death is knowing a spell that thy opponent knows not. From the Bill of Fare at the Herb Shops, the observer can glean the names of the reagents: Sulphurous Ash; Ginseng; Garlic; Spider Silk; Blood Moss; and Black Pearl.

	<p>Furthermore, there are reputed to be two others, more powerful still than those just listed. However, they are not for sale according to the proprietors of the Herb Shops. They are Nightshade and Mandrake root.

	<p>Only certain classes of the eight major professions have any talent for magic. Some are quite strongly endowed, such as Magi and Druids, while the Paladins, Bards, Tinkers and Rangers have but a little power. Fighters and Shepherds have no magical ability at all. In fact, Magi are so tuned to the special energy that comprises magic that when they cast a spell, a blue aura glows around their head and shoulders.

	<p>While most spells are reputed to possess either offensive or defensive abilities, some are utilitarian in nature, such as Light, Open and View spells. The rare aeromancer can harness the power of the winds. An ancient scroll on display in the Library at the Lycaeum tells of different types of energy fields created by means magical. It lists the following fields and discusses their properties.

	<p><b>SLEEP</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A green field that may bring sleep to anyone who passes through it.

	<p><b>LIGHTNING</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A blue field that serves as an impenetrable barrier which inflicts damage upon any who touch it.

	<p><b>FLAME</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;An orange field that imparts massive damage upon those foolish enough to try to cross it.

	<p><b>POISON</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;A violet field of noxious vapors that poisons anyone passing through who is not quick to hold their breath.

	<p>Whether these fields may be controlled by magic is uncertain. However, the scroll was concerned with the tale of a Wizard's battle! One can only ponder whether the writer survived the encounter.
