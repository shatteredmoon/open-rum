	<h1 class="u4m" style="text-align: left">CHAPTER IV</h1>
	<h2 class="u4m">MERCANTILE</h2>

	<p>There is a thriving merchant class in Britannia. Each town and village has its own shops that specialize in local wares and services. The seasoned traveller will discover many delightful and useful items to purchase, as well as a wide variety of places to eat and sleep.

	<p>The monetary system of Britannia is based on Lord British's heraldic charge. It is  a gold coin with a silver serpent cast vermeil upon the gold. The process is so difficult that the coin has never been successfully counterfeited or debased in value. This coin has been the foundation of the realm's stability and is universally accepted by merchants. Coins of the realm are also to be found in the chests that appear from time to time and are found below the surface in the dank dungeons. Beware, as most chests have diabolical traps in place to confound thieves.

	<p>Here is a partial list of some of the popular shops and their wares:

	<p><b>WEAPONS SHOP</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here one may purchase the finest in weaponry that blacksmiths can forge.  Depending on the skills of the local artisans, a shop might offer the following range of weapons:

	<center>
	<p><table><tr>
		<td class="u4m"><center>Staff <br> Dagger <br> Sling <br> Mace <br> Axe </center></td>
		<td class="u4m"><center>Sword <br> Bow <br> Crossbow <br> Flaming oil <br> Halberd </center></td>
	</tr></table>
	</center>

	<p>The weapon shops also offer liberal trade-ins on used equipment, although if thy axe is greatly notched from battle, do not expect much for it.

	<p><b>ARMOURY</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Fine armour may be purchased in the armouries of Britannia. 'Tis just the item to keep highwaymen from slipping a dirk into thy ribs! The local armoury may offer any of the following selection:

	<center>
	<p><table><tr>
		<td class="u4m"><center> Cloth <br> Leather <br> Chain <br> Plate </center></td>
	</tr></table>
	</center>

	<p>The armouries will likewise offer trade-ins on used armour, although most would not consider them liberal. By the time most fighters get around to seeking improved armour, the old armour is almost completely falling apart, and its principal value is as scrap for the foundries.

	<p><b>PUB</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The subjects of Lord British truly prize their pubs, and it shows in the gracious hospitality to be found in all public houses. Most offer an excellent array of drinks and food for the wayfarer. It is also commonly known that the bartenders are incurable gossips -- if asked the right question and offered the right price -- rare news may be obtained. Public drunkenness is prohibited throughout the lands of Britannia, so temper thy indulgence with wisdom.

	<p><b>GROCERY</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Little is worse than being far from town and finding thyself and one's companions starving to death because the person in charge of the expedition (thou) hast forgotten to buy enough food. Be sure to lay in a plentiful supply at each opportunity. Thy fellow travellers will most certainly appreciate thy foresight.

	<p><b>THE HEALER</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Some towns contain these invaluable places of aid where one may go to be healed when suffering from grievous wounds. Remember to heal thy companions also, for a healthy party ensures survival in the wild regions. The Healers are the only ones who may cure victims of the noxious venoms inflicted by the inhuman denizens of the land.

	<p><b>INN</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The numerous inns of Britannia provide tired travellers with a comfortable night's sleep, which refreshes and revitalizes each character. The character of the inns throughout Britannia varies, as does the price.

	<p><b>HERB SHOP</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;All practitioners of the mystic arts will search far and wide to locate these rare shops. Within them is to be found the components -- or reagents, as they are known to enchanters -- for spell mixtures. Without these mixtures, no spell may be cast successfully. Due to the rareness of some of the herbs, many are not offered for sale regularly, if at all. The known magical reagents are:

	<center>
	<p><table><tr>
		<td class="u4m"><center> Sulphurous Ash <br> Ginseng <br> Garlic <br> Spider Silk </center></td>
		<td class="u4m"><center> Blood Moss <br> Black Pearl <br> Nightshade <br> Mandrake Root </center></td>
	</tr></table>
	</center>

	<p>Care should be taken to mix the herbs in the correct proportions, so as not to waste the valuable ingredients.

	<p><b>GUILD SHOP</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;The Thieves' Guild has been essentially driven out of Britannia, but rumors persist of its existence somewhere in the ocean, perhaps on one of the uncharted islands. Somehow, the Guild maintains contact with the mainland, perhaps through the brazen pirates. The goods once offered by the Guild were expensive, but invaluable to the travelLer who sought to stray off the beaten path in search of novel experiences.

	<p><center><img src="img/ankh.gif" alt=""></center>	

	<p>These are the main shops in Britannia. A few other places exist that are worthy of note:

	<p><b>SHRINES</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Here the devout of each town may meditate upon their Path in life. Each shrine responds to the meditation of a different Mantra (chant). Consistency and concentration are the keys to meditation. Enlightenment is attained only through care.

	<p><b>THE SEER HAWKWIND</b>.&nbsp;&nbsp;Residing within Lord British's castle is the Royal Seer, Hawkwind. Many aspire to tread the Path, but very few find their way.  Seek the advice of the Seer as to thy progress upon the Path. He can look into thy heart's heart and read thy progress or failure. Heed his advice, for feet that have strayed may be brought back upon the Path.
