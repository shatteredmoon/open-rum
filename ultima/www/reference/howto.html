	<p>ARROW KEYS  Control movement. North/South/East/West
	
	<p>* Special Note: Talking with the people found in the game is 
	one of the most important features of Ultima 
	IV to master. It is almost impossible to solve thy quests 
	without talking to virtually all people in each 
	towne. Each person with whom thou dost Talk is capable of a 
	full conversation. They can be asked about 
	their "Name", "Job", and "Health". Thou may "Look" again at 
	their visual description. From this 
	information thou shouldst be able to discern what else they 
	might know, hinted at directly by use of the 
	precise words in the conversation. For example: If thou were 
	to ask Dupre about his "Job" and he were to 
	respond "I am hunting Gremlins," thou might think to ask 
	him about "Hunting" or "Gremlins" - about 
	either of which he might offer some insight. 
	
	<p>Each of these people might ask of thee a question as well; be 
	sure to answer the question 
	honestly, for dishonesty will be remembered and not reflect 
	well on thee for the rest of the game. Often 
	thou shalt not know what to ask a townesperson until thou 
	hast been told by another: e.g. Iolo the bard 
	might tell thee to ask Shamino the Ranger about swords. 
	Even if thou hadst met Shamino earlier thou 
	wouldst not have known to ask about swords, and thus thou 
	wouldst have to seek him out again if thou 
	dost wish that knowledge.
	
	<p>When thou art through with a 
	conversation, then speak the word "Bye" as an accepted 
	means of politely ending thy conversation.
	Be sure to keep a journal of thy travels! Many of the clues to 
	solving the quests of Ultima IV art 
	contained in the various and diverse conversations thou might 
	have with the various townesfolk. It would 
	be next to impossible to solve this game without some means 
	of referring back to prior conversations held 
	during play.
	
	<p>Some of the <!--people-->players that thou shalt meet may be willing to 
	become thy travelling companions. <!--If 
	thou dost wish for a character to become a player in thy party, 
	thou must ask them to "Join" thee.--> 'Tis 
	most wise to strengthen thy party as rapidly as possible<!--, up to 
	the seven companions thou shall need to 
	complete the game-->.
	
	<p>Be sure to thoroughly explore the cities and townes! Many of 
	the quests within Ultima IV art 
	contained entirely within individual cities. 'Tis wisest to 
	spend a great deal of fime seeking out the 
	answers that lie hidden in each one of the various townes of 
	Britannia, before moving on to another. 
	NOTE: During thy conversations with people in Ultima IV, 
	thou may feel the impulse to show thy 
	generosity to less fortunate fellows. Thou may do so by 
	saying: "Give".
	
	<!--<p>Thy party is seen here standing on a point of land that jut: 
	into the sea. To the North is a castle, while a 
	ship rocks gently on the waves to the Northwest. Just above 
	the ship one can see a towne. Thy party 
	consists of three travellers - British, Iolo and Geoffrey - 
	whose names appear in the Party Window. Their 
	current status is also therein displayed: British hath 372 Hit 
	Points and is in Good condition; Iolo hath 
	380 Hit Points and is suffering from Poison; and Geoffrey 
	hath 380 Hit Points and is in Good condition. 
	The narrow window below 'indicates that the party hath 24 
	units of Food and 1823 Gold pieces. The 
	symbol in the center indicates if any spells art currently 
	active.
	
	<p>Paused to cross a bridge, thy party can see an approaching 
	band of Skeletons to the Northeast.  At the top 
	of the view window thou can see the current status of the twin 
	moons Trammel and Felucca, which is 
	Crescent Waning for Trammel and Felucca is in its Last 
	Quarter.  The moonphases art represented as 
	follows:
	
	<p>Thou art currently checking on the status of the traveller lolo 
	and his attributes show in the Party 
	Window.  Thou can see that he is a Male Bard whose 
	condition is Good, he is possessed of 13 Magic 
	Point, 16 Strength, 19 Dexterity, 13 Intelligence; he hath 
	attained Level 4; cuffently hath 376 Hit Points, 
	with a flit Point Maximum of 400, and hath 714 Experience 
	Points.  His current weapon is a Sling, while 
	he wears Cloth Armour.
	
	<p>Thy party can be seen at the bottom part of the view window, 
	engaged in mortal combat with four Pirates 
	who art aboard their ship.  Note that as each member of thy 
	party bath the opportunity to strike a blow, 
	their current weapon is displayed below their name. The 
	direction of the wind is indicated at the bottom of 
	the view window.  If thou were to win this combat and take 
	possession of the vessel, the full Strength of 
	the ship would be displayed in the narrow window where thy 
	gold would normally be displayed.-->
	
	<p>Magical ability is directly related to the Profession and 
	Intelligence of thyself and thy travelling 
	companions.  Magical strength is twice the Intelligence of the 
	spellcaster, with potential modified by 
	Profession.  The enchantment potential of the various 
	Professions is :
	
	<p>Mage - Full
	<br>Bard - One Half
	<br>Ranger - One Half
	<br>Fighter - None
	<br>Druid - Three Fourths
	<br>Paladin - One Half
	<br>Tinker - One Fourth
	<br>Shepherd - None
